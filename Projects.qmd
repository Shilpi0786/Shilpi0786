## 🌐 Technical Projects
# Network Intrusion Detection using Optimized SVM & Logistic Regression

## 🛡️ Project Overview

A machine learning pipeline developed in Google Colab to classify network traffic as 'Safe' or 'Malicious'. By analyzing behavioral features like authentication failures and CPU spikes, the model serves as a proactive defense mechanism against cyber threats.



## 🛠️ Key Technical Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized feature correlations using Pearson coefficients to identify primary threat indicators.
2. **Preprocessing:** Implemented `StandardScaler` for feature normalization and used stratified splitting to handle class distribution.
3. **SVM Kernel Analysis:** Evaluated **Linear, RBF, and Polynomial kernels** to find the optimal decision boundary.
4. **Probabilistic Baseline:** Developed a **Logistic Regression** model to compare distance-based classification with probabilistic outputs.



## 📊 Final Results
The **Linear SVM** outperformed other models in a balanced security context.

| Model | Accuracy | Recall (Detection Rate) | Precision | ROC-AUC |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SVM Linear** | **93%** | **92.3%** | **90.0%** | **0.981** |
| **Logistic Regression** | 92% | 92.3% | 87.8% | 0.980 |

### **Key Insight:**
The high **ROC-AUC of 0.981** suggests that the selected network features are highly discriminative. While the Polynomial kernel offered 100% precision, its lower recall makes it less suitable for high-security environments where missing an attack is a high-risk failure.

**Tools**: Google Colab, Python, Scikit-learn (SVM, Logistic Regression), Seaborn, Pandas
