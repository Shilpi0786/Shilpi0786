### Annoation on LLM Output 


Appendix - https://shilpi0786.github.io/Shilpi0786/Appendix.html

I have ensured authenticity and relevance in the annotation process. I carefully reviewed the LLM outline, got the basic idea behind the concept, and annotated it based on personalization, skills, projects, aligning it with my actual academic and professional experience. I have used drafts as structured starting points and made generic revisions-

personalization - I have updated my professional experience and added real-time projects I have been working on to highlight my skills and experiences. I have listed projects such as AWS static site deployments, customer churn analysis, and work on under academic coursework.I have added other business projects, such as POpIN and an unsweetened organic marketing project, to highlight my skills on real-time projects. I have worked with different clients.

Contextual Editing - Some of the LLM phrases were edited for clarity and professionalism to simplify my tone. I have tried to edit in formal and more authentic, engaging phrases. 

Visual and Structural Changes - I have added sections like skills with different highlights of my technical and soft skills.I have removed unauthentic certifications listed in examples and only placed the authentic certifications completed by me.I have also included a logo of my own design created using Canva for maki	ng it look visually appealing. Also, I have styled the CSS page using the styling formatting and dark-themed style for a bold look.	

Accuracy Checks- I have only included the experience, skills or certification which I hold and haven’t included LLM-generated inputs.


### Reflection 

Throughout the process of developing my MBA portfolio website, my use of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT evolved from simple content generation to a more conceptual format for the portfolio. Initially, I relied on the model to brainstorm ideas and draft text for common pages like the “About” and “Projects” sections. 

These early drafts were useful for establishing a clear structure and format, but they often included basic content, generic phrasing, and assumptions that needed to be changed. The project progressed, and I shifted from using the LLM as a content creator to treating it more like a web designer, developing a website and hosting portfolio on GitHub. I began prompting the model for specific tasks, such as rephrasing bullet points to make them more concise, rewriting project styles using CSS to make them more modern and visually appealing, and trying to fix issues and errors I faced in configuring the styles in markdown. This iterative approach allowed me to maintain full control over the authenticity of my content while benefiting from the speed and fluency of the model’s outputs.

One of the most valuable aspects of using an LLM was the ability to brainstorm alternate layouts or formatting ideas and redesign my entire portfolio on how I want it to be crafted. For example, I was able to insert contact forms, logos, and my project links in different formats for my “Projects & Case Studies” section, categorized in technical and business sections, by giving a brief description and listing the tools used to make it look more engaging. This allowed me to experiment with usability and visual hierarchy while staying focused on the message I wanted to communicate.

Ensuring accuracy was a critical part of the process. I fact-checked every data, tool, date, and description provided by the model and replaced any generic placeholders with details from my actual experiences, such as the PopIn Host Strategy project and the Unsweetened Juice Launch Plan and more real-life projects. I also annotated the LLM-generated drafts to indicate where changes were made for transparency, as required in the appendix.

This experience deepened my understanding of how to ethically and effectively collaborate with AI tools. Rather than passively accepting output, I engaged critically with it—filtering, refining, and aligning it with my voice, values, and academic requirements. Ultimately, the integration of LLMs enhanced both the quality and efficiency of my portfolio, while allowing me to focus on meaningful personalization and presentation.
